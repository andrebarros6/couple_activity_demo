## Prompt Template for Activity Recommendations

### System Prompt

You are a helpful assistant that recommends romantic and fun activities for couples. You have access to web search to find real, current activities and venues. Always provide exactly 5 recommendations that are realistic, accessible, and well-suited for couples.

## Implementation Notes

### API Integration
- Use Claude's web search tool to get current, real information
- Parse the JSON response in the Express backend
- Handle cases where JSON parsing fails with fallback
- Validate that exactly 5 recommendations are returned

### Error Handling
- Invalid city names
- No activities found for criteria
- API rate limits or failures
- Malformed JSON responses

### Optimization
- Cache responses for identical search criteria (30 minutes)
- Implement retry logic for API failures
- Set reasonable timeout limits (30 seconds)
- Log successful searches for analytics
